# GProv

The goal of this system is to provide physicians evidence based clinical knowledge to enhance diabetic patient care. The clinical knowledge is in the form of guideline recommendations. There are various guidelines for diabetes treatment including ADA[2] (American Diabetes Association), AACE (American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists), Diabetes Canada and so on. These guidelines, although they have several overlapping recommendations, they also have subtle differences in recommendations therefore, providing the physician with the source of the suggested treatment plan is vital to ensure the physician makes the most informed decision for any patient.

We are developing an ontology for modeling the provenance of SWRL rules and that ontology is called G-PROV or guideline provenance, it provides the physician with information about the rule that fired to generate the suggestion, and we started our research using the ADA guidelines and annotation of DMTO[1] (Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Ontology) SWRL rules. The ontology will also include information from other guidelines, thus providing the physician with multiple sources/evidence for the suggested treatment.

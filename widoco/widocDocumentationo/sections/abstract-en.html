<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Provenance can be used to enhance transparency and trust of recommendations generated by clinical decision support systems, thereby assisting healthcare practitioners by providing them with ample information to make more informed decisions. While some general provenance ontologies exist, they lack provenance terms aimed at guidelines. Provenance can be used to resolve ambiguity and conflicts between various guideline sources. It can also enable the decision support system to be easily updated when new guidelines are released. We have developed our guideline provenance ontology, by extending existing provenance ontologies, to enable accurate encoding of the source of the reasoning rules that decision support systems rely on to generate diagnosis and treatment suggestions. Our ontology enables provenance representation at different granularity levels, and can be used to annotate rules with citation backed evidence sentences and other sources of knowledge such as figures and tables. </span>
